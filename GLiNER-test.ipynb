    "these surveys extended onto the relinquished portion of the tenement. No significant\n",
    "anomalies were identified over the relinquished portion of the tenement.\n",
    "A total of 13 aircore holes were drilled by WMC on the relinquished ground (Figure 12). The\n",
    "results were generally disappointing with very low to background nickel and gold values.\n",
    "Results are presented in Appendix Il.\n",

    "technique, as the variability of the Billiton sampling and the broad spacing of the\n",

    "staggered grid. A total of 745 samples was taken.\n",
    "Samples were collected using an auger rig mounted on a 4WD, and using a DGPS to locate\n",
    "the sample sites. The depth of sample collection was no less than 30 centimetres and\n",
    "samples were taken from the most calcareous layer. The reaction of the sample with HCl\n",
    "acid was used to determine the relative amount of carbonate within the soil. Samples of\n",

    "for analysis for gold (1ppb detection limit) by aqua regia digest with an AAS graphite furnace\n",
